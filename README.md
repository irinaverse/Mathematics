## Mathematics in Data Science and Machine Learning

"The Beauty of Mathematics, LaTeX and Scientific Python" is my first ever writing in my tech study.
- Math has the same capacity for beauty as art, music and a full blanket of stars on a dark night.
- LaTeX is a software system, created in 1985. It started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists but has also been taken by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic or Greek. The most beautiful math formulas, signs and letters I have ever seen, are written in LaTeX.
- Scientific Python is fancy and elegant.

"Limits, Integrals, Infinitesimals" - the idea of calculus
- Integrals are the most elegant signs in the math gang.
- What is the area under the curve?
- Infinitesimal or infinity small
- We are not talking numbers here, we talk ideas

"Data Science Math"
- a function is a process, we explore something new
- $Matplotlib$ is a library in Python, excellent tool for data visualization

"Encoding Math into Python"

- Mathematics - the science of structure, shape and order.
- Nature follows the Fibonacci sequence, from seeds to galaxies, we recognize patterns.
- Visual explanations and changing perspectives.
- The Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky gives us an interesting view about geometry.
- This paper is not finished yet, but which scientific work is?
