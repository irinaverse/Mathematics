## Mathematics in Data Science and Deep Learning

"The Beauty of Mathematics, LaTeX and Scientific Python" is my first ever writing in the field.
- Math has the same capacity for beauty as art, music and a full blanket of stars on a dark night.
- LaTeX is a software system, created in 1985. It started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists but has also been taken by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic or Greek. The most beautiful math formulas, signs and letters I have ever seen, are written in LaTeX.
- Scientific Python is fancy and elegant.
